      "description": "Ironically, I am not the biggest fan of mustard, the sauce. However, this flannel really caught my eye as a quality layering piece. It's sturdy, comfortable, and eye-catching (in my opinion). It errs on the less breathable side despite being 100% cotton due to the thickness. I think it's best worn on a chillier day.",

This parka has kept me plenty warm since it comes with a (removable) fleece lining. I'd often wear it during the fall and winter. If my Adidas Ultraboosts weren't in the wash at the time of taking this photo, you can bet they'd be a part of this outfit.",

      "description": "Pairing a flannel with a pair of jeans or chinos is such a simple outfit that it almost feels incomplete. It's possible to layer a jacket or sweater on top of the flannel, but depending on the weather and the occasion, it's also very possible to wear it on its own. I do however, appreciate the fact it takes little mental energy on my part to settle on an outfit. Call me lazy, but you can catch me in this outfit pretty often",

I could have just as easily worn this jacket on a morning jog, lounging around at home, or getting groceries. It just so happens to also go well with a shirt and tie on a chilly day. The foresty green plays nicely with the other earthy tones of the belt, pants, and shoes.",

I think I could improve on this outfit by also dressing up my footwear. Some leather boots could add a nice contrast in textures and color. The sneakers seem out of place. They do seem slightly more acceptable to my eyes when the jacket is off though.",

I'm a fan of all-dark colors, so long as it's not monocolor (though I make an exception for black on black). I think this works because of how my top and bottom are slightly different shades of blue. It also definitely helps that dark colors are more slimming. Even though I'm wearing denim on denim, the fact that they're dark wash as opposed to light wash makes this outfit more 'muted' or 'quiet' if that makes sense.",

      "description": "What goes with olive just as well as navy, if not better? Light blue. I feel like this color combination is some kind of underrated hidden gem. This speaks more to my ignorance about style and color pallets than anything. I think it's fairly well known that grey can go well with blues, but olive just adds another dimension. It fulfills a similar role here to that of a pair of dark grey pants. However, the hint of green accentuates the brown belt and shoes. Maybe it's like seeing a clear blue sky overlooking a lush forest. Who am I kidding? I just really like this outfit.",
